# Privacy Policy — Amor&Contas: Bill Splitter

Effective date: February 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains the data practices of Amor&Contas ("we", "our", "the App") for the version of the App distributed via the App Store.

Summary: The App does not collect or transmit personal data to us or to third parties. All user-entered data (expenses, names, notes, scales) is stored locally on the user's device by default. The App does not use analytics, crash reporting, cloud sync, or any remote tracking services in its default configuration.

## 1. No Data Collection

- We do not collect personal data from users. The App stores all expense records and settings locally on the device only.
- The App does not transmit your expense data, names, or notes to our servers or to third parties.
- The App does not include analytics, crash reporting, or background data collection.

## 2. Sharing and Exporting

If you choose to share a settlement message or export data using the App's share feature, the content you share (which may include names and amounts you included) is passed to the sharing mechanism you choose (e.g., Messages, Mail, or other apps) and handled by that service's privacy policy. That action is initiated by you and is not stored or transmitted by us.

## 3. Purchases

Any in-app purchases or subscriptions are processed by Apple (App Store). We do not receive or store your payment card details.

## 4. Local Storage and Retention

All user data is retained locally on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. If you delete the App or its data, the local records are removed from your device.

## 5. Security

We recommend protecting your device (passcode, biometric lock) and backups. While data is stored locally, no electronic storage is perfectly secure.

## 6. International Use

Because the App does not transmit personal data to us, there are no international transfers of your personal data by the App.

## 7. Your Rights

Because we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, requests to access or delete personal data held by the developer are generally unnecessary. If you have support inquiries about local data, please use the contact method listed on the App Store product page for this app.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy; the effective date will reflect the latest version.

## 8. Contact

For privacy questions or support regarding local data, use the contact method shown on the App Store product page.

If you later enable any third-party analytics, crash-reporting, cloud syncing, or remote services, update this policy to list those services and the data they process.
